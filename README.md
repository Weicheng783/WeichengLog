# UI
The app was designed using [Material 3 guidelines](https://m3.material.io/).

The Screens and UI elements are built entirely using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).

The app has two themes:

- Dynamic color - uses colors based on the [user's current color theme](https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you) (if supported)
- Default theme - uses predefined colors when dynamic color is not supported

Each theme also supports dark mode.

The app uses adaptive layouts to
[support different screen sizes](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/large-screens/support-different-screen-sizes).
